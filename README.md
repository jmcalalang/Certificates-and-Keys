# Certificates-and-Keys

This Postman Collection and Environment Variable setup contains the needed pieces to bring in Certs and Keys to a BIG-IP via REST. Cert and Key needs to be available from URL source (http://key.key, http://cert.crt). Along with the import of the certificate & Key, this Collection can also be used for Client-SSL Profile creation and applying to a Virtual Server.

| ï»¿Environment Variable   | Value                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
|                        |                             |
| big_ip_mgmt            | FQDN or IP of BIG-IP        |
| big_ip_auth_token      | AUTH Token                  |
| cert_location          | http://location_of_cert.crt |
| key_location           | http://location_of_cert.key |
| virtual_server         | Virtual Server Name         |
| new_client_ssl_profile | Client SSL Profile Name     |


To create a fully automated solution this can  be added with the f5devcentral/f5-super-netops-container available at https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-super-netops-container, which contains the needed pieces to dynamically populate Environment Variables off responses (Auth Token).

The easiest way to import the Collection and Environment into Postman is via the "Import from Link" option:
